# Python exercises
![Python][pylogo]

These are some small exercises from the python course I am studying - Check it out at [Píldoras informáticas][pycurso] (by Juan Díaz). I will be uploading my programs here until I complete it. This is also my first time using git!

Exercises are divided into folders:
- [CALC](#calc) - Basic calculator using Tkinter.
- [CRUD_GUI](#crud_gui) - CRUD app using Tkinter and SQLite3.
